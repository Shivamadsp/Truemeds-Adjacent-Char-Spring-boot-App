# Truemeds-Adjacent-Char-Spring-boot-App
The main purpose of making this application is to feed and fetch duplicate string character from the database and remove the adjacent duplicate and then again save the data with 
some other information into another table.
This spring boot application uses jpa/hibernate to hit the MySql db and uses Swagger for the documentation and hitting the controller class.
